    <p id=maincontent> The picture above is our beloved rat called Cashew, she has been a member of our family since early 2016 and she is going on a year old now. She is amazing and a prime example of how rats can impact our lives much more than pets but as family. We took her in from Southern Ag and was a feeder rat but we took her in as a baby and she loves it here. She lays in her hammock most of the day and loves to climb and bounce around.
